# Urban-electricity-consumption-data
Accurate estimation of electricity consumption at multi-temporal resolutions is crucial for formulating safe and efficient energy management strategies. However, reliable data on daily and monthly urban electricity consumption is often limited. This study develops a top-down approach based on multi-source data to measure the daily and monthly electricity consumption at city-level. Using this method, we calculated the daily and monthly electricity consumption for 296 cities in China. Additionally, we explored the validity of the measurement results from multiple perspectives. This dataset is highly consistent with the officially released national-scale electricity consumption statistics, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8878. The dataset in this study can be used for analysis in a variety of cutting-edge research fields, such as urban power system resilience assessment, urban power system risk management strategy and policy development.
